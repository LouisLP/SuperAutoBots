# SuperAutoBots 🤖🐢

> **NOTE**: this is a work in progress. It is not yet ready for use. The only reason it's up on GitHub is to give a starting point for others who want to build their own bot.
> The main issue is with the image recognition — despite having images straight from the wiki, the bot is not able to consistently recognize them with confidence intervals from 0.5 to 0.99.
